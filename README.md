# About The Project 

In this hackathon we were asked to build our own marketplace on any technology stack. This is our project, we hope you like it!

## Our Project Proposal 🥕

Our idea was to create FruverShop, a marketplace where users could post ads to buy and sell organic fruits and vegetables, locally.
